Calling all Obsidian users! If you've been looking for a cost-effective way to share your digital garden with the world, we've got exciting news. Today, we're launching Flowershow Cloud - a publishing platform built specifically with Obsidian users in mind.

## Why Flowershow Cloud?

If you're an Obsidian user, you know the power of Markdown for organizing your thoughts and knowledge. But sharing that knowledge with the world is often either expensive or involves wrestling with deployment processes, server configurations, and technical complexities. That's where Flowershow Cloud comes in.

Whether you're:

- Sharing your PKM (Personal Knowledge Management) system
- Creating documentation from your vault
- Building a blog

Flowershow Cloud handles the technical aspects while you focus on what you do best - creating and connecting knowledge.

## Pricing That Makes Sense

We believe sharing knowledge shouldn't break the bank. That's why Flowershow Cloud offers:

- **Free Tier**: Get started at no cost and publish your digital garden
- **Premium Tier**: Only $5/month

## Preserving Your Obsidian Experience

Flowershow Cloud understands your Obsidian content. Your published site will maintain:

- **[[Wiki Links]]**: Your internal links work exactly as they do in Obsidian
- **Callouts**: From info and warning to tip and note blocks
- **Code Blocks**: With the same syntax highlighting you're used to
- **Math Equations**: Your LaTeX formulas render perfectly
- **Mermaid graphs**: Your diagrams, flowcharts, and sequence diagrams render automatically

Other features:

- **Custom CSS**: Customise the style of your website
- **Comments section**: Comments section powered by GitHub discussions.

Coming soon...

- üöß **Graph View**: Showcase your note connections to visitors
- üöß **Embedded Notes**: Keep your transclusions working seamlessly

## How to Publish Your Vault

1. **Prepare Your Vault**: Choose which notes you want to make public _comment: Maybe let's use `publish: false` - same as in Obsidian publish for easier switch. Let people know they can also use .gitignore ?_
2. **Push to GitHub**: Create a repository in your vault and push it to GitHub
3. **Publish with Flowershow Cloud**: Create a site from your GitHub repository
4. **Done!**
